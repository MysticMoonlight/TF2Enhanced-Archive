# A letter to everyone
Hello everyone,

As you may know, the Team Fortress 2: Enhanced (or TF2:E) has been cancelled. This letter is to explain what happened.

## What happened?
As you may heard or not, several popular mods like Team Fortress 2 Classic and Open Fortress downloads were taken down due to Valve's arrangement.
Their development team had a discussion with Valve, the creator of Team Fortress 2 about releasing it on steam. After taking down, they did not received any emails from Valve related to arrangement since several month has passed.

And recently, the Casual servers were infested by several types of bots and cheaters, leading to #savetf2 protest to happen. Valve responded about the situation of the game, but never explained about the future plans of TF2.

Anyways, back to the discussion. Because of no response from Valve, all Team Fortress 2 mod creators started distributing the TF2 Mods just like before.

After few days, Valve [silently made changes](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading/distributing_source_engine) which clearly explains that they are no longer supporting modding community, following this descriptions:

> *"We have in the past granted access to the source code of some of our games to a small number of modding teams who could demonstrate a need that could not be met by the SDK. We may do this again in the future under exceptional circumstances but because of the associated support burden and risk of leaks our default answer is to develop based on the SDK."*

Silently changing the words while not responding to community's voice led us to be shocked. We felt like we were betrayed by Valve until now. This was the most reason why this project had to be cancelled. We did not wanted to support the developers who cannot even manage the game, and now ignoring the community's voice.

Additionally TF2 mods are not that popular unlike Left 4 Dead 2. For L4D2, the modding is very popular because of their steam workshop feature.

Casual servers always have `sv_pure 1` enabled which means it only supports small amount of mods. Because of that, most people always use less mods, compared with other games.

This explains everything about the cancellation of TF2 Project.

## That's too bad. What will be your next plan?
As many people want the mods to be back regardless of criticism for just one game, we will only cancel TF2 project. We want to apologize to everyone who was disappointed to our decision. From now on, we will stand with Mod developers and Modding community to keep the game alive.
Because of that, the following projects will resume its development:
* Black Mesa: Enhanced
* Half-Life 2: Enhanced
* Left 4 Dead 2: Revengeance Reborn
* Team Fortress 2 Classic: Enhanced

## Thank You
We want to say thank you to every mod developers, project contributors for keeping the Team Fortress 2 alive.
Huge thanks to Sloofy for your best contribution and keeping the archives alive before the project being removed.

## Note
This repository includes the latest archives of Team Fortress 2: Enhanced. You are free to continue this project under the same name, if you do not care about the popularity and Valve's attitude towards community.
