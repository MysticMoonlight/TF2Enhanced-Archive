# Team Fortress 2: Enhanced Lite
Team Fortress 2: Enhanced is a modpack focused on improving the overall visuals and sound effects while keeping the original TF2 atmosphere.

Due to licensing issues, the entire modpack will not be available to download, so you must download each mod individually from the links below.

This version is a lite version of Team Fortress 2: Enhanced, aiming for complete sv_pure 1/Valve server compatibility.

# Changelog
See [here](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EnhancedMod/blob/main/tf2e/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install
1. Download the mods you want from the links below.
2. Extract the archive file you downloaded (it should end with `.zip`, `.rar`, or `.7z`).
3. Move the folder or .vpk file to `tf/custom` folder inside Local Files (To access local files, Go to Properties -> Local Files -> Browse...)
	* 2-1. **Attention to Linux/macOS users!** If the folder contains uppercase and/or spaces, you must rename the folder to contain only lowercase characters, otherwise TF2 cannot detect the folder mod(s) upon launch!
4. Launch the game, and enjoy the modpack!
