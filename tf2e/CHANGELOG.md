### Highlight

* On the main menu, Scout and Pyro now have stronger rim lights
* On the main menu, Scout's right arm (our left) is pulled further back to resemble the source material better
* On the main menu, Scout's fingers on his bat have been adjusted to resemble the source material better
* On the main menu, Medic's head has been slightly adjusted to resemble the source material better
* In Soldier's class portrait, he has his finger on the trigger of the rocket launcher (in vanilla TF2, this detail is missing)
* In Pyro's class portrait, they have been given the same pose as their class selection render for consistency
* In Heavy's class portrait, his gun has been adjusted to be even closer to him to account for healthbar clipping
* In the class portraits, lighting has been updated and overhauled on the following classes: Scout, Soldier, Demo, Heavy, and Medic
* In the class portraits, the following classes have been given higher quality weapon models: Soldier, Scout, Heavy, and Medic
* BLU team main menu renders have been renamed (previously fwk_*, now blu_*)
* A potential shading issue has been resolved that creates phantom shadows / lines over the class portraits (This was a problem with the minDistance value being too high)
* Removed redundant hudplayerclass.res file
* On the main menu, Scout's face no longer has light clipping through the hat onto his eyebrow.
* On the main menu, Scout's Wrap Assassin used in his Smissmas render no longer floats in mid-air.
* On the main menu, Medic's shirt on his plague doctor costume has less clipping to it.
* On the main menu, Medic's left arm (our right) curves in far neater to reduce a shading issue.
* On the main menu, Medic's vampire costume has far less clipping on his left arm (our right).
* On the main menu, Medic's glasses on his plague doctor costume are neatly concealed without resorting to post-processing tricks.
* On the main menu, Medic's strait jacket straps now properly attach to the other end like they're supposed to.
* On the main menu, Medic's fingers on the strait jacket have less clipping to them (there is still some leftover, but it's far less noticeable).
* In the class portraits, Heavy and Sniper should clip into the healthbar less.
