# How to Install
## Base Mods

2. Extract the archive file you downloaded (it should end with `.zip`, `.rar`, or `.7z`).
3. Move the folder or .vpk file to `tf/custom` folder inside Local Files (To access local files, Go to Properties -> Local Files -> Browse...)
	* 2-1. **Attention to Linux/macOS users!** If the folder contains uppercase and/or spaces, you must rename the folder to contain only lowercase characters, otherwise TF2 cannot detect the folder mod(s) upon launch!
